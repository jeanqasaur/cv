\cventry{Spring 2017}{Co-Instructor, Software Foundations of Security and Privacy (15-316)}{Carnegie Mellon University}{}
  {}{Designed and taught new undergraduate course with goal of teaching students to formally specify and prove security and privacy properties, with topics including safety, information flow, and statistical privacy.}
\cventry{Fall 2016}{Instructor, Domain-Specific Languages (15-819)}{Carnegie Mellon University}{}
  {}{Designed and taught experimental discussion-based graduate special topics seminar on programming language design and evaluation across a variety of domains, with focused units on systems programming, security and privacy, and biological modelling. Reviews averaged 4.6/5.0 (teaching) and 4.0/5.0 (course) with course size of 8.}
\cvlistitem{"Definitely offer this course again and at the undergraduate level. Not many discussion-based courses happen in CS and they should."}
\cvlistitem{"I feel like this course gave me a great opportunity to read a bunch of DSL papers and really understand the current state of the field. Thanks for a great semester!"}
